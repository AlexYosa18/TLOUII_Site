      <h2>What is the game about?</h2>
      <p>Five years after their dangerous journey across the post-pandemic United States, Ellie and Joel have settled down in Jackson, Wyoming. Living amongst a thriving community of survivors has allowed them peace and stability, despite the constant threat of the infected and other, more desperate survivors.
        When a violent event disrupts that peace, Ellie embarks on a relentless journey to carry out justice and find closure.</p>

          <h2>Accessibility options for The Last of Us Part II </h2>
          <p>From the very beginning, Naughty Dog's goal has been to ensure that as many fans as possible have an opportunity to experience the game through their most robust accessibility feature set to-date.
            Building upon the foundations established with UNCHARTED 4: A Thief’s End, The Last of Us Part II features more than 60 accessibility settings, with expanded options focused on fine-motor and hearing, as well as completely new features that benefit low-vision and blind players. 
            Naughty Dog encourages everyone to take advantage of these features to create a gameplay experience that’s right for them.
            One challenge in creating a large number of configurable options is making you aware of which options might be relevant for your needs. In addition, many features were created to work well in concert with one another. To help with this, Naughty Dog created three accessibility presets that configure all the recommended settings for vision, hearing and motor accessibility, vision accessibility preset, hearing accessibility preset, and moter accessibility preset.
            There are over 60 accessibility options in the game, here are some examples: Fully customisable controls, allowing you to remap every command to a different controller input, including touch pad swipes and controller shake. Camera assist, automatically  reorients the camera in the direction of your movement. Auto weapon swap and pickup. Lock on aim with changeable strength. Fully customisable HUD, changing the colours, scale, background, and more. Options for motion sickness effected players, with options for the camera shake, motion blur, dolly zoom effect, field of view, camera distance, full screen effects and a persistent center dot. Navigation and traversal assistance, ledge guard, infinite breath underwater, skip puzzle option, an enhanced listen mode, with adjustable scan range and time. Text to speech and audio cues. Combat accessibility options, with Hostages don’t escape, allies don’t get grabbed, enemies don’t flank, reduced enemy perception and accuracy, enhanced dodge, invisible while prone, option for weapon sway, slow motion. Adjustable game difficulty, with player, enemy, ally, stealth and resource options.</p>
